# Gō Finance

Gō Finance is a cooperative DeFi platform. To use the farms, users must contribute to the shared fund by paying deposit fees. Smart contracts use the shared fund to automatically execute custom strategies that generate rewards for all depositors.

The web interface is open source and anyone can download and run it locally on their computer. Smart contracts have no owner privileges and run an immutable set of rules. They are deployed on Polygon and Fantom.

Keep in mind that trading is a risky activity that can involve a loss of money. You should only invest the amount you can afford to lose.

## Tokenomics

fGō is a fully decentralized token that can be staked to earn rewards. There are performance fees on some strategies that buy fGō from the market, which helps increase its price. The name comes from the gō (合) or cup, which is a traditional Japanese unit used for a serving of rice and a cup of sake in Japanese cuisine.

Token name: fGō

Total supply: 1 million

## Gō farm

You can deposit your fGō tokens to earn fGō rewards that are variable and subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Your rewards increase with your staking power, which depends on how often you harvest your rewards: the longer the time between harvests, the higher the staking power.

You can harvest up to one time per day, but the maximum staking power is reached after one year without harvesting, at which point you must harvest to continue earning rewards.
