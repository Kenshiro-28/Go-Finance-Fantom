# Gō Finance

Gō Finance is a 100% decentralized DeFi platform with an open source web interface that anyone can download and run locally on their computer.

Smart contracts have no owner privileges and run an immutable set of rules. They are deployed on Polygon, BNB Smart Chain and Fantom.

Keep in mind that trading is a risky activity that can involve a loss of money. You should only invest the amount you can afford to lose.

## Tokenomics

fGō is a fully decentralized token with limited supply and very slow issuance, which makes it a good store of value. The name comes from the gō (合) or cup, which is a traditional Japanese unit used for a serving of rice and a cup of sake in Japanese cuisine.

Token name: fGō

Total supply: 1 million

## Gō farm

You can stake your fGō tokens to earn fGō rewards that are variable and subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Your rewards increase with your staking power, which depends on how often you harvest your rewards: the longer the time between harvests, the higher the staking power.

You can harvest up to one time per day, but the maximum staking power is reached after one year without harvesting. Keep in mind that your rewards may suddenly increase or decrease depending on how much other users harvest and the total deposits on the farm, so the most conservative approach is frequent harvests.
